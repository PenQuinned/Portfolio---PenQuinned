    <h2>Get to know me!</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Quinn, a young coder!</p>
    <p>I love coding and I do it alot! I won the Coding With Kids Superstar Coder Award. And I do Python, HTML, Javascript, CSS, and, well, when i was younger i did alot of Scratch ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. I also like robotics, and engineering! So, anyways, here are some facts about me!
</p>
<p>Some of my Python projects include: Escape To The Cyberverse, a fun escape game, where you anwser questions to get to your freedom! BATTLE OF THE SHIPS is a battleship game, but funner. Lame fortune machine, where you get lame/funny fortunes. And Wage Calculator, where you can calculate how much money you get! Please note that these are all on Replit, but i still have many projects on Codesters that i can't share. Like a Hopping game, a driving game, and many more!</p>
<p>Some of my HTML/Javascript/CSS projects are: Penguins, a short article. BrickBreaker, smash your way through the wall! And Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport info, i give some info on the airport! And Quesiddila clicker, where you click the quesidilla forever, and ever, and ever, and ever!</p>
    
<p>Ok so, i do more stuff than just coding! I really enjoy tennis, swimming, video games (of course), making videos, and hanging out with friends!</p>

<p>In school my favorites are math, science, and yup, technology!</p>

<p>I like making Youtube videos. I mainly do gaming, but i also do 3d animation!</p>

<p>When i grow up i want to probably be a hardware engineer, and maybe a software engineer. And i want to work for Apple. So Apple, if you're seeing this, give me a call! </p>

<p>I am really interested in airplanes, like i memorized alot of their names ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>

<p>I live in Michigan. Michigan is cold, yes. But it is amazing in the summer!</p>
